# wheat-rust
Wheat Leaf Rust is a devastating disease affecting the crops of millions of African farmers. Detecting such plant diseases early can save tonnes of agricultural produce every year. This will benefit not only the general population by reducing hunger, but also the farmers by ensuring they get the harvest they deserve. To address this challenge, we propose a deep learning algorithm which given an image of a plant, classifies if the plant is healthy, has stem rust or has leaf rust. We explore a variety of state-of-the-art models and come up with a modified DenseNet Model of our own. Our experiments explore the performance of our model with various ablations. We submitted our model at ICLR Work- shop Challenge 1: CGIAR Computer Vision for Crop Disease. We stood 39th among 847 participating teams and our model achieved a competitive log-loss of 0.265.
